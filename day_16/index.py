# break , continue and pass

# ! break :The break statement in Python is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is present. After that, the control will pass to the statements that are present after the break statement, if available.

# for / while loop:
#     # statement(s)
#     if condition:
#         break
#     # statement(s)
# loop end

# for i in range(1 , 10):
#   if i == 5 :
#     break ;
#   print(i)
# ! continue statement : Continue is also a loop control statement just like the break statement. continue statement is opposite to that of the break statement, instead of terminating the loop, it forces to execute the next iteration of the loop.

# for / while loop:
#     # statement(s)
#     if condition:
#         continue
#     # statement(s)

# for i in range(1 , 10):
#   if i == 5 :
#     continue ;
#   print(i)




# ! pass statement : As the name suggests pass statement simply does nothing. The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute. It is like a null operation, as nothing will happen if it is executed. 

# function/ condition / loop:
#    pass


for i in range(1 , 12) :
  pass
