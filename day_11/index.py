# ! indention 

# if we talk about other programming language then it doesn't matter if you are giving any indention or not but in python it is must because in python there is not concept of brackets 

# name = "123"
# if(name == "12344"){
# print("correct")
# }else{
#  print("wrong")
# }

# ! but in python 

name = "123"
if name == "12344":
  print("correct")
else:
  print("incorrect")
